## 📘 Project 1: Robust Monocular Depth Estimation Against Adversarial Camouflage

### Overview
This research investigates how adversarial camouflage (in the form of 2D patches) can deceive Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models used in autonomous vehicles. It evaluates the vulnerability of state-of-the-art models and enhances their resilience through adversarial training.

### Highlights
- **Models tested**: Monodepth2, DenseDepth, ZoeDepth, AdaBins, DPT, MiDaS
- **Technique**: 2D adversarial patch attacks using 3D2Fool algorithm
- **Defense**: Adversarial training applied on DenseDepth

### Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Depth Estimation Error (Ed)
- Ratio of Affected Region (Ra)
- SSIM, RMSE, Abs Rel, Sq Rel, Log10

### Key Takeaways
- Adversarial training significantly improved robustness without sacrificing performance on clean images.
- ZoeDepth and AdaBins showed high accuracy but varied vulnerability.

### Models Used
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest (RF)
- AdaBoost (AB)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Ensemble (Max Voting)

### Experiment Types
- Binary classification (Benign vs Attack)
- Three-class (Benign, DoS, Spoofing)
- Multi-class (Specific attack types like RPM, Speed, Steering)

### Dataset: CICIoV2024
- Includes benign traffic and spoofing/DoS attacks
- Supports binary and decimal data formats

### Key Metrics
